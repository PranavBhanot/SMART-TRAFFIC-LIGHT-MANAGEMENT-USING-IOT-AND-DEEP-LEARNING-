# Vehicle-Detection-using-Cascade-learning-for-Traffic-Management
The following model is for using on raspberry pi.
Due to its slightly lower performance we have used a cascade learning which divides the objects into positive and negative classes which then the model learns to detect.


# Process for building a smart traffic light is as follows: 
Data collection: Sensors such as cameras, radar, and loop detectors are installed at intersections to collect real-time data on traffic flow, vehicle and pedestrian counts, and other variables.

Analysis: The data collected by the sensors is sent to a central control system that uses algorithms to analyze the information and determine the best traffic signal timing patterns for each intersection.
Adjustment: The control system then adjusts the timing of the traffic lights based on the analysis to improve the flow of traffic, reduce congestion, and improve safety.

Monitoring: The system continually monitors the traffic flow and adjusts the signal timing as needed to respond to changing traffic patterns.

Overall, SMART traffic lights help to create a more efficient and safer transportation system by using real-time data and advanced algorithms to optimize traffic flow at intersections

# Statistics
According to a report by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, India had 4.12 lakh road accidents in 2021, resulting in 1.53 lakh deaths and 3.84 lakh injuries.
According to a study conducted by a global consultancy firm, traffic congestion
costs the economy Rs 1.47 lakh crore annually.
The study was conducted during peak hours in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata.
Traffic congestion increases vehicle emissions and degrades ambient air quality, and recent studies have shown excess morbidity and mortality for drivers, commuters and individuals living near major roadways.

# Unique Features
Decentralized traffic control, resilient to network outages.
All computations are done on-board and thus, do not depend on any external softwares and cloud services.
A raspberry pi is highly portable and easy to setup.
